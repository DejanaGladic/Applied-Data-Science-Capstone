Completed and commented labs from the course Applied-Data-Science-Capstone found at the following link: https://www.coursera.org/learn/applied-data-science-capstone/home.

The concepts of data collection and processing were applied, as well as the application of machine learning algorithms for decision-making. JupyterLab and Python programming language were used for implementation.

This listened course was preceded by two: https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/home and https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning-with-python/home.
